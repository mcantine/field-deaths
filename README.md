# field-deaths
Database of deaths during geological fieldwork, 2000-2021.

This database of field deaths was compiled by Marjorie Cantine in mid-2021. The goal of this project is to better understand the causes of death for geologists doing fieldwork so that future fieldwork can be safer. This project is largely compiled from news sources and the OSHA fatality database. It includes perma.cc archived links to those sources.  

I acknowledge that you may know people included in the database, and that it may be jarring to encounter deceased friends, family, colleagues, and loved ones in this context. One of my goals with this database is to honor and remember fallen colleagues and to provide data to mitigate risk in the future. I invite you to share the names and stories of Earth scientists who have not been included in the current iteration of the database, or to contact me to correct the database where errors are found. You can contact me at mcantine@mit.edu (until December 31, 2021) or mcantine@gmail.com.
